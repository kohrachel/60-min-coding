# 60-min-coding
Weekly hour-ish-long coding projects :) Built with AI

Every week, [@zineanteoh](https://github.com/zineanteoh) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.

# Project List (so far): 

1. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/kohrachel/w1-pet-rock) | Pet the Rock. Test your free will.
2. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/kohrachel/w2-3d-about-me) | Desk messiness is directly correlated with genius.
3. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/kohrachel/w3-cursor-not-allowed-v0) | No cursors allowed. 
4. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/kohrachel/w4-mini-wikipedia) | Wikipedia is cool. Rachel-pedia is cooler.
